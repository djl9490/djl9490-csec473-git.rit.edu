Homework 3 Red Team Tool

file_parser.sh is a simple tool that gives 4 options:

1. R - Remove all files and directories in current directory
2. V - View all files and directories in current directory
3. F - Only remove files in current directory
4. H - Hide all files and directories in current directory
