Homework 3 Red Team Tool

file_parser.sh is a simple tool that gives 4 options:

1. R - Remove all files and directories in current directory
2. V - View all files and directories in current directory
3. F - Only remove files in current directory
4. H - Hide all files and directories in current directory

The script itself is just if statements to handle the command of the user and then runs the command requested. It can only work with files in the directory you are running the script from.

Installation/Usage: 

Put the file_parser.sh in your system and run the following command:
**chmod +x file_parser.sh**

To allow you to execute the script.

Then go to the directory you want to parse through and run the command and follow the menu instructions that appear.
